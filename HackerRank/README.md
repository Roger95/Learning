HackerRank is a technology company that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers and businesses, where developers compete by trying to program according to provided specifications. HackerRank's programming challenges can be solved in a variety of programming languages (including Java, C++, PHP, Python, SQL, JavaScript) and span multiple computer science domains.

I will be posting every challenge higher than easy here to show my thought process and, sometimes, comparing my answer to other people's answer and why I did it differently (and what I learnt from them).
