# Codewars

Profile: https://www.codewars.com/users/Roger95

Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as Kata. These discrete programming exercises train a variety of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online Integrated development environment.

I will be posting every Kata higher than 7 kyu here to show my thought process and, sometimes, comparing my answer to other people's answer and why I did it differently (and what I learnt from them).
